# Goerli Faucet Project

This project allows anyone to call the **withdraw method** and specify an amount lower than .1 ETH at a time. The **receive fallback function** will handle any ETH deposited into the Faucet and add it to the contract balance.

The contract is deployed at the following address: 0xcF2dbd0Dddae2d100729F5bDf1feAe0E9Cc0b439 on Goerli Ethereum Testnet.
